## About

TakeNote is a note-taking app for the web. You can use the demo app at [takenote.dev](https://takenote.dev). It is a static site without a database and does not sync your notes to the cloud. The notes are persisted temporarily in local storage, but you can download all notes in markdown format as a zip.
